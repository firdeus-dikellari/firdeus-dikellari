## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python, AI/ML, and system internals.  
Currently focused on **Red Teaming**, **AI exploitation**, and **offensive security research**.

I bridge the gap between **AI systems** and **security**, exploring vulnerabilities in machine learning pipelines, LLMs, and real-time systems. I build from the ground up and break to learn.

## 🎯 Core Focus Areas

- 🔐 **Offensive Security**: CTFs, red teaming labs, post-exploitation, custom payloads  
- 🤖 **Adversarial AI**: Model poisoning, prompt injection, data backdoors, AI-driven exploits  
- 🔬 **System-Level Programming**: C#, Linux internals, memory manipulation, reverse engineering  
- 🛠️ **Security Automation**: Python tooling for recon, exploitation, and monitoring  
- 📡 **Networking**: Packet analysis, wireless hacking, enumeration, and pivoting
